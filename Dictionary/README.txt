DESCRIPTION
-----------
The compilation of the dictionaries is divided into three steps:
1. We searched on the Internet freely available websites that were used as sources for the extraction of lists of slang words, contractions, and abbreviations.
2. From the selected sources, we manually extracted the lists of slang words, contractions, and abbreviations along with their corresponding meanings in each 
language (English, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch). We created different files with the same structure for each web source.
3. Once we had all the lists in different files, we proceeded to join all the files of the same nature. We formatted and cleaned each file, we also removed 
the duplicated entries. Finally, we manually checked the meanings of each entry in the dictionaries.

Each dictionary is ordered alphabetically, and each file is consists of two columns separated by a tabulation. The first column corresponds to a slang word, 
abbreviation or contraction entry, according to the nature of the dictionary. The second column corresponds to the meaning of the entry.

The statistics for each dictionary is presented bellow:
